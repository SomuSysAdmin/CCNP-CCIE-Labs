## How to use
Each lab should have a "new lab" and a "finished lab" version (more may be included at creator's discretion). 
To start a lab, use the "new lab" option, and finally to confirm answers / get a hint / tshoot, use the final version. 

## How to create labs
* Clone this repo
* Create your lab file with the initial config
* Add commits for each task / action for the lab. 
* Submit a PR for the final lab.
